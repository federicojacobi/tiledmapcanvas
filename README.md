# tiledmapcanvas
This is a very simple JS script to render tiled maps ( http://mapeditor.org ) saved as JSON on a canvas element. Needless to say, it is **very** rudimentary, and not full featured, but by all means add features!

# How to make it work
You must have Node, npm, webpack, babel, json-loader(very important), etc, etc, etc ... The works ... enough to run ES6. To start the dev version `npm run start`

Once on the browser, user arrow keys to move the map.

Happy coding!
